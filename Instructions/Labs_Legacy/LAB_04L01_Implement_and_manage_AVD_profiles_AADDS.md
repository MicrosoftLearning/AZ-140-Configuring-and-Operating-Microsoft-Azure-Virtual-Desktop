and select **OK** to close the group **Properties** window. 
1. In the **Local Users and Groups** console, double-click the **FSLogix Profile Exclude List** group enty, note that it does not include any group members by default, and select **OK** to close the group **Properties** window. 

   > **Note**: To provide consistent user experience, you need to install and configure FSLogix components on all Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts. You will perform this task in the unattended manner on the other session host in our lab environment. 

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to install FSLogix components on the **az140-21-p1-1** session host:

   ```powershell
   $server = 'az140-21-p1-1' 
   $localPath = 'C:\Source\x64'
   $remotePath = "\\$server\C$\Source\x64\Release"
   Copy-Item -Path $localPath\Release -Destination $remotePath -Filter '*.exe' -Force -Recurse
   Invoke-Command -ComputerName $server -ScriptBlock {
      Start-Process -FilePath $using:localPath\Release\FSLogixAppsSetup.exe -ArgumentList '/quiet' -Wait
   } 
   ```

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, start **Windows PowerShell ISE** as administrator and, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to configure profile registry settings on the **az140-21-p1-1** session host:

   ```powershell

   $profilesChildKey = 'Profiles'
   $fileShareName = 'az140-22a-profiles'
   Invoke-Command -ComputerName $server -ScriptBlock {
      New-Item -Path $using:profilesParentKey -Name $using:profilesChildKey -Force
      New-ItemProperty -Path $using:profilesParentKey\$using:profilesChildKey -Name 'Enabled' -PropertyType DWord -Value 1
      New-ItemProperty -Path $using:profilesParentKey\$using:profilesChildKey -Name 'VHDLocations' -PropertyType MultiString -Value "\\$storageAccountName.file.core.windows.net\$using:fileShareName"
   }
   ```

   > **Note**: Before you test the FSLogix-based profile functionality, you need to remove the locally cached profile of the ADATUM\wvdaadmin1 account you will be using for testing from the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts you used in the previous lab.

1. Switch to the Bastion session to **az140-cl-vm11a**, within the Bastion session to **az140-cl-vm11a**, switch to the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window and, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to remove the locally cached profile of the ADATUM\aaduser1 account:

   ```powershell
   $userName = 'aaduser1'
   $servers = 'az140-21-p1-0','az140-21-p1-1'
   Get-CimInstance -ComputerName $servers -Class Win32_UserProfile | Where-Object { $_.LocalPath.split('\')[-1] -eq $userName } | Remove-CimInstance
   ```
