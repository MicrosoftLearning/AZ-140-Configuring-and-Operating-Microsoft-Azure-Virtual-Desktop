## Instructions

### Exercise 1: Prepare for and create MSIX app packages

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Prepare for configuration of Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts
1. Deploy an Azure VM running Windows 10 by using an Azure Resource Manager QuickStart template
1. Prepare the Azure VM running Windows 10 for MSIX packaging
1. Generate a signing certificate
1. Download software to package
1. Install the MSIX Packaging Tool
1. Create an MSIX package

#### Task 1: Prepare for configuration of Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts

1. From your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in by providing credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you will be using in this lab.
1. On the lab computer and, in the web browser window displaying the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to start the Azure Virtual Desktop session host Azure VMs you will be using in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-21-RG' | Start-AzVM -NoWait
   ```

   >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -NoWait parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the Azure VMs are actually started. 

   >**Note**: Proceed directly to the next task without waiting for the Azure VMs to start.

#### Task 2: Deploy an Azure VM running Windows 10 by using an Azure Resource Manager QuickStart template

1. From your lab computer, in the web browser window displaying the Azure portal, in the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu select **Upload**, and upload the files **\\\\AZ-140\\AllFiles\\Labs\\04\\az140-42_azuredeploycl42.json** and **\\\\AZ-140\\AllFiles\\Labs\\04\\az140-42_azuredeploycl42.parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.
1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to deploy an Azure VM running Windows 10 that you will use for creating MSIX packages to and to join it to the Azure AD DS domain:

   ```powershell
   $vNetResourceGroupName = 'az140-11-RG'
   $location = (Get-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $vNetResourceGroupName).Location
   $resourceGroupName = 'az140-42-RG'
   New-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Location $location
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
     -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
     -Location $location `
     -Name az140lab0402vmDeployment `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/az140-42_azuredeploycl42.json `
     -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az140-42_azuredeploycl42.parameters.json
   ```

   > **Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next task. This might take about 10 minutes. 

#### Task 3: Prepare the Azure VM running Windows 10 for MSIX packaging

1. From your lab computer, in the Azure portal, search for and select **Virtual machines** and, from the **Virtual machines** blade, in the list of virtual machines, select the **az140-cl-vm42** entry. This will open the **az140-cl-vm42** blade.

   reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\RDInfraAgent\MSIXAppAttach /v PackageListCheckIntervalMinutes /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
   ```

   > **Note**: The last of these registry changes disables User Access Control. This is technically not required but simplifies the process illustrated in this lab.

#### Task 4: Generate a signing certificate

> **Note**: In this lab, you will use a self-signed certificate. In a production environment, you should be using a certificate issued by either a public Certification Authority or an internal one, depending on the intended use.

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-cl-vm42**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to generate a self-signed certificate with the Common Name attribute set to **Adatum**, and store the certificate in the **Personal** folder of the **Local Machine** certificate store:

   ```powershell
   New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -Subject "CN=Adatum" -KeyUsage DigitalSignature -KeyAlgorithm RSA -KeyLength 2048 -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My"
   ```

1. From the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to start the **Certificates** console targeting the Local Machine certificate store:

   ```powershell
   certlm.msc
   ```

1. In the **Certificates** console pane, expand the **Personal** folder, select the **Certificates** subfolder, right-click the **Adatum** certificate, in the right-click menu, select **All Tasks** followed by **Export**. This will launch the **Certificate Export Wizard**.

### Exercise 4: Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned and used in the lab

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned and used in the lab

>**Note**: In this exercise, you will deallocate the Azure VMs provisioned and used in this lab to minimize the corresponding compute charges

#### Task 1: Deallocate Azure VMs provisioned and used in the lab

1. Switch to the lab computer and, in the web browser window displaying the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to list all Azure VMs created and used in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-21-RG'
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-42-RG'
   ```

1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to stop and deallocate all Azure VMs you created and used in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-21-RG' | Stop-AzVM -NoWait -Force
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-42-RG' | Stop-AzVM -NoWait -Force
   ```

   >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -NoWait parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the Azure VMs are actually stopped and deallocated.
