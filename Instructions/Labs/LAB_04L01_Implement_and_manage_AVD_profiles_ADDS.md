6. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, start Microsoft Edge and navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). If prompted, sign in by using the Azure AD credentials of the user account with the Owner role in the subscription you are using in this lab.
7. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, open a PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane. 
8. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to start the Azure Virtual Desktop session host Azure VMs you will be using in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-21-RG' | Start-AzVM
   ```

   >**Note**: Wait until the Azure VMs are running before you proceed to the next step.

9. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, start Microsoft Edge, browse to [FSLogix download page](https://aka.ms/fslogix_download), download FSLogix compressed installation binaries, extract them into the **C:\\Allfiles\\Labs\\04** folder (create the folder if needed), navigate to the **x64\\Release** subfolder, double-click the **FSLogixAppsSetup.exe** file to launch the **Microsoft FSLogix Apps Setup** wizard, and step through the installation of Microsoft FSLogix Apps with the default settings.

   > **Note**: Installation of FXLogic is not necessary if the image already includes it.

10. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, start **Windows PowerShell ISE** as administrator and, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to install the latest version of the PowerShellGet module (select **Yes** when prompted for confirmation):

   ```powershell
   [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
   Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force -SkipPublisherCheck
   ```

11. From the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to install the latest version of the Az PowerShell module (select **Yes to All** when prompted for confirmation):

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -SkipPublisherCheck
   ```

12. From the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to modify the execution policy:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
   ```

13. From the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to sign in to your Azure subscription:

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   ```

14. When prompted, sign in with the Azure AD credentials of the user account with the Owner role in the subscription you are using in this lab.
15. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to retrieve the name of the Azure Storage account you configured earlier in this lab:

   ```powershell
   $resourceGroupName = 'az140-22-RG'
   $storageAccountName = (Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName)[0].StorageAccountName   
   ```

16. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to configure profile registry settings:

   ```powershell
   $profilesParentKey = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\FSLogix'
   $profilesChildKey = 'Profiles'
   $fileShareName = 'az140-22-profiles'
   New-Item -Path $profilesParentKey -Name $profilesChildKey –Force
   New-ItemProperty -Path $profilesParentKey\$profilesChildKey -Name 'Enabled' -PropertyType DWord -Value 1
   New-ItemProperty -Path $profilesParentKey\$profilesChildKey -Name 'VHDLocations' -PropertyType MultiString -Value "\\$storageAccountName.file.core.windows.net\$fileShareName"
   ```

17. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, right-click **Start**, in the right-click menu, select **Run**, in the **Run** dialog box, in the **Open** text box, type the following and select **OK** to launch the **Local Users and Groups** console:

   ```cmd
   lusrmgr.msc
   ```

18. In the **Local Users and Groups** console, note the four groups which names start with the **FSLogix** string:

   - FSLogix ODFC Exclude List
   - FSLogix ODFC Include List
   - FSLogix Profile Exclude List
   - FSLogix Profile Include List

19. In the **Local Users and Groups** console, in the list of groups, double-click the **FSLogix Profile Include List** group, note that it includes the **\\Everyone** group, and select **OK** to close the group **Properties** window. 
20. In the **Local Users and Groups** console, in the list of groups, double-click the **FSLogix Profile Exclude List** group, note that it does not include any group members by default, and select **OK** to close the group **Properties** window. 

   > **Note**: To provide consistent user experience, you need to install and configure FSLogix components on all Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts. You will perform this task in the unattended manner on the other session hosts in our lab environment. 

21. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to install FSLogix components on the **az140-21-p1-1** and **az140-21-p1-2** session hosts:

   ```powershell
   $servers = 'az140-21-p1-1', 'az140-21-p1-2'
   foreach ($server in $servers) {
      $localPath = 'C:\Allfiles\Labs\04\x64'
      $remotePath = "\\$server\C$\Allfiles\Labs\04\x64\Release"
      Copy-Item -Path $localPath\Release -Destination $remotePath -Filter '*.exe' -Force -Recurse
      Invoke-Command -ComputerName $server -ScriptBlock {
         Start-Process -FilePath $using:localPath\Release\FSLogixAppsSetup.exe -ArgumentList '/quiet' -Wait
      } 
   }
   ```

   > **Note**: Wait for the script execution to complete. This might take about 2 minutes.

22. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to configure profile registry settings on the **az140-21-p1-1** and **az140-21-p1-1** session hosts:

   ```powershell
   $profilesParentKey = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\FSLogix'
   $profilesChildKey = 'Profiles'
   $fileShareName = 'az140-22-profiles'
   foreach ($server in $servers) {
      Invoke-Command -ComputerName $server -ScriptBlock {
         New-Item -Path $using:profilesParentKey -Name $using:profilesChildKey –Force
         New-ItemProperty -Path $using:profilesParentKey\$using:profilesChildKey -Name 'Enabled' -PropertyType DWord -Value 1
         New-ItemProperty -Path $using:profilesParentKey\$using:profilesChildKey -Name 'VHDLocations' -PropertyType MultiString -Value "\\$using:storageAccountName.file.core.windows.net\$using:fileShareName"
      }
   }
   ```

   > **Note**: Before you test the FSLogix-based profile functionality, you need to remove the locally cached profile of the **ADATUM\\aduser1** account you will be using for testing from the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts you used in the previous lab.

23. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-21-p1-0**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to remove the locally cached profile of the **ADATUM\\aduser1** account on all Azure VMs serving as session hosts:

   ```powershell
   $userName = 'aduser1'
   $servers = 'az140-21-p1-0','az140-21-p1-1', 'az140-21-p1-2'
   Get-CimInstance -ComputerName $servers -Class Win32_UserProfile | Where-Object { $_.LocalPath.split('\')[-1] -eq $userName } | Remove-CimInstance
   ```

23. Select the folder you identified in the previous step and note that it contains a single file named **Profile_aduser1.vhd**.

### Exercise 2: Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned and used in the lab

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned and used in the lab

>**Note**: In this exercise, you will deallocate the Azure VMs provisioned and used in this lab to minimize the corresponding compute charges

#### Task 1: Deallocate Azure VMs provisioned and used in the lab

1. Switch to the lab computer and, in the web browser window displaying the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
2. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to list all Azure VMs created and used in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-21-RG'
   ```

3. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to stop and deallocate all Azure VMs you created and used in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-21-RG' | Stop-AzVM -NoWait -Force
   ```

   >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -NoWait parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the Azure VMs are actually stopped and deallocated.
