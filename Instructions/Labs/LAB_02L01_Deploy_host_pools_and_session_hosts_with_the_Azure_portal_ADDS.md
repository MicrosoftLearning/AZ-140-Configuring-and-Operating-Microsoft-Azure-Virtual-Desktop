1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-dc-vm11**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to add all members of the **ADATUM\\az140-wvd-users** to the local **Remote Desktop Users** group on the Azure VM **az140-cl-vm11** running Windows 10 which you deployed in the lab **Prepare for deployment of Azure Virtual Desktop (AD DS)**.

   ```powershell
   $computerName = 'az140-cl-vm11'
   Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computerName -ScriptBlock {Add-LocalGroupMember -Group 'Remote Desktop Users' -Member 'ADATUM\az140-wvd-users'}
   ```

On the **Installation Scope** page of the **Remote Desktop Setup** wizard, select the option **Install for all users of this machine** and click **Install**. If prompted by User Account Control for administrative credentials, authenticate by using the **ADATUM\\Student** username with **Pa55w.rd1234** as its password.
1. Once the installation completes, ensure that the **Launch Remote Desktop when setup exits** checkbox is selected and click **Finish** to start the Remote Desktop client.

#### Task 2: Subscribe to a Azure Virtual Desktop workspace

1. In the **Remote Desktop** client window, select **Subscribe** and, when prompted, sign in with the **aduser1** credentials, by providing its userPrincipalName you identified earlier in this lab and the password you set when creating this account.

   > **Note**: Alternatively, in the **Remote Desktop** client window, select **Subscribe with URL**, in the **Subscribe to a Workspace** pane, in the **Email or Workspace URL**, type **https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/api/arm/feeddiscovery**, select **Next**, and, once prompted, sign in with the **aduser1** credentials (using its userPrincipalName attribute as the user name and the password you set when creating this account).

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-cl-vm11**, in the **Remote Desktop** client window, in the list of applications, double-click **Command Prompt** and verify that it launches a **Command Prompt** window. When prompted to authenticate, type the password you set when creating the **aduser1** user account, select the checkbox **Remember me**, and select **OK**.

   > **Note**: Initially, it might take a few minutes for the application to start, but subsequently, the application startup should be much faster.

   > **Note**: If you are presented with the **Welcome to Microsoft Teams** sign-in prompt, close it.

1. At the Command Prompt, type **hostname** and press the **Enter** key to display the name of the computer on which the Command Prompt is running.

   > **Note**: Verify that the displayed name is **az140-21-p1-0**, **az140-21-p1-1** or **az140-21-p1-2**, rather than **az140-cl-vm11**.

1. At the Command Prompt, type **logoff** and press the **Enter** key to log off from the current Remote App session.
1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az140-cl-vm11**, in the **Remote Desktop** client window, in the list of applications, double-click **SessionDesktop** and verify that it launches a Remote Desktop session.

### Exercise 3: Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

>**Note**: In this exercise, you will deallocate the Azure VMs provisioned in this lab to minimize the corresponding compute charges

#### Task 1: Deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

1. Switch to the lab computer and, in the web browser window displaying the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to list all Azure VMs created in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-21-RG'
   ```

1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to stop and deallocate all Azure VMs you created in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-21-RG' | Stop-AzVM -NoWait -Force
   ```

   >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -NoWait parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the Azure VMs are actually stopped and deallocated.
