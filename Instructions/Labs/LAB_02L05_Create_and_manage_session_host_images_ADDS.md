## Instructions

### Exercise 1: Create and manage a session host image
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Prepare for configuration of a Azure Virtual Desktop host image
1. Deploy Azure Bastion
1. Configure an Azure Virtual Desktop host image
1. Create an Azure Virtual Desktop host image
1. Provision an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool by using the custom image

#### Task 1: Prepare for configuration of a Azure Virtual Desktop host image

1. From your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in by providing credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you will be using in this lab.
1. In the Azure portal, open **Cloud Shell** pane by selecting on the toolbar icon directly to the right of the search textbox.
1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. 
1. On the lab computer, in the web browser displaying the Azure portal, from the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a resource group that will be used to contain the Azure Virtual Desktop host image:

   ```powershell
   $vnetResourceGroupName = 'az140-11-RG'
   $location = (Get-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $vnetResourceGroupName).Location
   $imageResourceGroupName = 'az140-25-RG'
   New-AzResourceGroup -Location $location -Name $imageResourceGroupName
   ```

1. In the Azure portal, in the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu select **Upload**, and upload the files **\\\\AZ-140\\AllFiles\\Labs\\02\\az140-25_azuredeployvm25.json** and **\\\\AZ-140\\AllFiles\\Labs\\02\\az140-25_azuredeployvm25.parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.
1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to deploy an Azure VM running Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session that will serve as the source image:

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
     -ResourceGroupName $imageResourceGroupName `
     -Name az140lab0205vmDeployment `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/az140-25_azuredeployvm25.json `
     -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az140-25_azuredeployvm25.parameters.json
   ```

   > **Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next exercise. The deployment should take about 5-10 minutes.

#### Task 2: Deploy Azure Bastion 

> **Note**: Azure Bastion allows for connection to the Azure VMs without public endpoints which you deployed in the previous task of this exercise, while providing protection against brute force exploits that target operating system level credentials.

> **Note**: Ensure that your browser has the pop-up functionality enabled.

1. In the browser window displaying the Azure portal, open another tab and, in the browser tab, navigate to the Azure portal.
1. In the Azure portal, open **Cloud Shell** pane by selecting on the toolbar icon directly to the right of the search textbox.

### Exercise 2: Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

>**Note**: In this exercise, you will deallocate the Azure VMs provisioned in this lab to minimize the corresponding compute charges

#### Task 1: Deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

1. Switch to the lab computer and, in the web browser window displaying the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to list all Azure VMs created in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-25-RG'
   ```

1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to stop and deallocate all Azure VMs you created in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-25-RG' | Stop-AzVM -NoWait -Force
   ```

   >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -NoWait parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the Azure VMs are actually stopped and deallocated.
