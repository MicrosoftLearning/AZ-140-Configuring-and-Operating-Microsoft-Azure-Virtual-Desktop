#### Task 1: Prepare for deployment of an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool by using an Azure Resource Manager template

1. From your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in by providing credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you will be using in this lab.
1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Virtual machines** and, from the **Virtual machines** blade, select **az140-dc-vm11**.
1. On the **az140-dc-vm11** blade, select **Connect**, in the drop-down menu, select **Connect via Bastion**.
1. When prompted, provde the following credentials and select **Connect**:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |User Name|**Student**|
   |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

1. Within the Bastion session to **az140-dc-vm11**, start **Windows PowerShell ISE** as administrator.
1. Within the Bastion session to **az140-dc-vm11**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to identify the distinguished name of the organizational unit named **WVDInfra** that will host the computer objects of the Azure Virtual Desktop pool hosts:

   ```powershell
   (Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter "Name -eq 'WVDInfra'").distinguishedName
   ```

1. Within the Bastion session to **az140-dc-vm11**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to identify the user principal name attribute of the **ADATUM\\Student** account that you will use to join the Azure Virtual Desktop hosts to the AD DS domain (**student@adatum.com**):

   ```powershell
   (Get-ADUser -Filter "sAMAccountName -eq 'student'").userPrincipalName
   ```

1. Within the Bastion session to **az140-dc-vm11**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to identify the user principal name of the **ADATUM\\aduser7** and **ADATUM\\aduser8** accounts that you will use to test personal desktop assignments later in this lab:

   ```powershell
   (Get-ADUser -Filter "sAMAccountName -eq 'aduser7'").userPrincipalName
   (Get-ADUser -Filter "sAMAccountName -eq 'aduser8'").userPrincipalName
   ```

   > **Note**: Record all user principal name values you identified **and** the distinguished name for the WVDInfra OU. You will need them later in this lab.

1. Within the Bastion session to **az140-dc-vm11**, from the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** script pane, run the following to calculate the token expiration time necessary to perform a template-based deployment:

   ```powershell
   $((get-date).ToUniversalTime().AddDays(1).ToString('yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffZ'))
   ```

   > **Note**: The value should resemble the format `2022-03-27T00:51:28.3008055Z`. Record it since you will need it in the next task.

   > **Note**: A registration token is required to authorize a host to join the pool. The value of token's expiration date must be between one hour and one month from the current date and time.

1. Within the Bastion session to **az140-dc-vm11**, start Microsoft Edge and navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). If prompted, sign in by using the Microsoft Entra credentials of the user account with the Owner role in the subscription you are using in this lab.

### Exercise 2: Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Stop and deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

>**Note**: In this exercise, you will deallocate the Azure VMs provisioned in this lab to minimize the corresponding compute charges

#### Task 1: Deallocate Azure VMs provisioned in the lab

1. Switch to the lab computer and, in the web browser window displaying the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** shell session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to list all Azure VMs created in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-23-RG'
   ```

1. From the PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to stop and deallocate all Azure VMs you created in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup 'az140-23-RG' | Stop-AzVM -NoWait -Force
   ```

   >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -NoWait parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the Azure VMs are actually stopped and deallocated.
